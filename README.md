# Image-Copyright-Protection-based_on-AI-Image-Data-Poisoning-Demo
AI Image Data Poisoning is a Python script that demonstrates how to add imperceptible perturbations to images, known as adversarial noise, which can disrupt the training process of AI models.
This technique aims to protect artists' images by introducing subtle modifications that hinder the performance of AI algorithms without significantly altering the appearance of the images to human observers.


## Overview

As AI algorithms become increasingly prevalent in analyzing and generating images, there is a growing concern about the potential misuse or misinterpretation of visual content. AI Image Data Poisoning provides a defense mechanism against unauthorized use or exploitation of artists' images by introducing imperceptible perturbations that disrupt the training process of AI models.


## Concept

The concept behind AI Image Data Poisoning is to leverage adversarial noise, a form of imperceptible perturbations, to disrupt the training process of AI models without significantly altering the appearance of the images to human observers. By adding subtle modifications to the images, the script aims to introduce ambiguity and uncertainty into the training data, making it more challenging for AI algorithms to accurately learn and generalize from the images.
